# cryptopals-rust

These are my cryptopals solutions in Rust! I was originally solving the challenges in C, but switched to Rust as I have been wanting to learn the language and thought this would be a fun challenge!

As I am still a beginner to both Rust and Crypto, I'm sure these solutions won't be perfect, but I'll keep learning and getting better! ðŸ˜¸
